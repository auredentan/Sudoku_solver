    """
    A sudoku solver using Linear programming module pulp.
    The solver is quite similar to the one presented in their
    `documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/CaseStudies/a_sudoku_problem.html>`_

    Args:
        img (`ndarray`): An array that contain the sudoku board.
        output_name (`str`, optional): The name of the output files (.png and .txt). Defaults to sudokusolution
        output_path (`str`, optional): The path of the folder where the logs and results are going to be saved.\
        Defaults to *output/*.

    Returns:
        A boolean to success or fail and create two files.
